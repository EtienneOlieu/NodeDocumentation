<h1>REST API</h1>

<h2>When sending or receiving data from one part of our application to another or an enirely different place, we need an API </h2>

<p>
    A REST API or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a client server communication protocol built around entities that can be accessed via URL - generally called end points.
    The data transfered can be:
</p>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>JSON</li>
<li>XML</li>
<p>
    The API also makes use of standardised HTTP methods that ensures a requests get an expected result. HTTP methods are:
</p>
<li>GET - retrieves a basic data entity, based on its ID</li>
<li>POST - creates a new data entity, based on properties defined in the app</li>
<li>PUT - replaces the contents of an existing data entity based on its ID</li>
<li>PATCH - replaces an element or entry of an existing data entity based on its ID</li>
<li>DELETE - deletes a data entity based on its ID</li>
<p>
    Furthermore the REST API is stateless, meaning that each request is independet and does not require the server to hold any information on the session.
</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>When designing the structure around the API - specifically the end points, there are certain agreed-upon standards that all REST API follow. 
    Let's go with an example: We are creating an application around knitting and yarn. 
    Our application can store information around different kinds of yarn and therefore we will be working from that. 
    The following are example endpoints given our yarn-app.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the order of the methods is also important as their placement in the application is also part of the standardization. 
    Anybody having to work maintenance on the application would expect the different methods to be found specific places.

    <code>
        GET - "/yarns"
        GET - "/yarns/&lt;id&gt;"
        POST - "/yarns"
        PUT - "/yarns/&lt;id&gt;"
        PATCH - "/yarns/&lt;id&gt;"
        DELETE - "/yarns/&lt;id&gt;"
    </code>
