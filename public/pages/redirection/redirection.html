<h1>Redirection</h1>

<h2>Redirection is the process in which a client is sent to another endpoint</h2>

<p>
    In order to handle security or error messages, it can be useful to redirect the client based on certain criteria.
    A redirect is something that happens on the server, where, if certain conditions are true, the client is sent to another endpoint.
    This might be something as simple as a timer redirecting after a short while or done after a check on certain credentials.
</p>
<p>
    The following is an example of a redirect based on a query string:
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        app.get("/api/banditcave", (req, res) => {
            console.log(req.query)
            if (req.query.passport === 'open-sesame') {
                return res.redirect("/api/treasure")
            }
                res.send({message: "You must speak the secret password to enter"});
        })
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    Unless the user writes a query with "open-sesame" they will not be sent to the trease api end point.
