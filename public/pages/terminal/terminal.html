<h1>Terminal</h1>

<h2>When working with Node™, or any other framework, it can be helpful to use terminal commands.</h2>

<p>
In general the terminal, whether it is bash or zshell, is used to handle commands to the computer directly.
These commands are helpful when working with code, as they give more direct control over different processes. 
When working with node we often end up using many of the same commands, that will be detailed below.
</p>
<p>
    When running the file we need to use the terminal. 
    First it is important to navigate to the correct folder, and then run the correct file.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        pwd <- prints the current work directory
        cd <- change directory
        cd .. <- change directory up one level in the folder hierarchy
        cd [folder name] <- changes directory to that folder
        cd [folder name]/[sub-folder name] <- can be chained with subfolders

        ls <- list shows the contents of the current directory
        ls -a <- lists all in directory
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    When typing in the terminal, it is <strong>not</strong> necessary to type the entire command, as a press on the tab ↹ key will complete or show suggestions for what is available/present in the current directory
</p>
<p>
    In order to run the file, to start debugging or actually running it, you will need to do a couple of things. 
    First you should navigate to the correct folder. Then you need to tell the system what it needs to run the file with.
    For our purposes it is node.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        node [filename]
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    This should execute your code once. When you need to exit the program again, this can be done with a tap of ctrl + c or ctrl + d depending on how hard of an exit you are looking for. In general an exit with ctrl + c is considered more safe.
    Since we are goint to work on something that needs to be checked severel time it is helpful if we install nodemon, a tool that allows the application to automatically restart whenever changes to the code are detected.
</p>

<h2> Node Package Manager</h2>
<p>Whenever we want to install extensions or packages as they are known in node we need to access the Node Package Manager.
    This is generally a command in your terminal where you need to specify which pacakge you wish to install.</p>
<p>
    note that these commands may require a sudo prefix on mac, as the changes attempted by NPM may be rejected otherwise.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        npm i [name of package]
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    Once nodemon is installed it may be good to create a new file in your project that tells nodemon which files it need to listen for changes in.
    The contents of this json file should look like this
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        {
            "ext": "js, json, mjs, html"
        }
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    Once all of this has been installed and readied, we no longer just use node when starting our application, but <strong>nodemon</strong>.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        nodemon [filename]
    </code>
</pre>

<h2>
    Git commands
</h2>
<p>
    When working on a project it is important to link it up to github, in order for it to be saved, shared and version controlled.
    In order to do this, first we must create a repository on github.com which will be given a name and be designated as a Node project. 
    Once we have a url we can open our terminal and start typing some commands.
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
            git clone [url] <- will clone a repository into your current wd
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    Once a repository is cloned and has had some code written to it locally it will need to be backed up to github.
    In order to do that we will first add the changes to be staged, then those changes should be commited with a comment on what they are, and finally the changes need to be pushed.
    Which can look like this:
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        git add -A
        git commit -m "this should be a pertinent commit message"
        git push
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    Once this has been done, the project should be visible and available on github at a level dependent on the visibility chosen when it was created.
