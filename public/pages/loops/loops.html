<h1>Loops</h1>

<h2>Javascript loop functions allow simple and short ways to iterate over any type of list.</h2>

<p>
    In many situations it becomes necessary to iterate over a list with multiple data elements.
    For this javascript has inbuilt functions for the types of actions that are most common.
    Before these functions became available in javascript, or other languages as well, since they have begun using similar functions as well, programmers had to write their own loops each time.

</p>
<p>
The following will list a number of the most common loop methods. I will examine each on the same sample array:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        //the array
        const eightiesActors = [
        {name: 'Arnold Schwarzenegger', genre: 'action'}, 
        {name: 'Sharon Stone', genre: 'thrillere'}, 
        {name: 'Tom Hanks', genre: 'comedy'}, 
        {name: 'Kim Bassinger', genre: 'romance'},
        {name: 'Sigourney Weaver', genre: 'science fiction'},
        {name: 'Tom Cruise', genre: 'action'}
        ]
    </code>
</pre>
<pre>
    <code>
        //foreach - runs through the list and does something for each element. 
        //In this example they have all died in a recent tragic plane crash.
        const yearOfDeath = eightiesActors.forEach((actor) => {
            actor.yearOfDeath = 2023;
        });

        // results in this list
        const eightiesActors = [
        {name: 'Arnold Schwarzenegger', genre: 'action', yearOfDeath: 2023}, 
        {name: 'Sharon Stone', genre: 'thrillere', yearOfDeath: 2023}, 
        {name: 'Tom Hanks', genre: 'comedy',  yearOfDeath: 2023}, 
        {name: 'Kim Bassinger', genre: 'romance',  yearOfDeath: 2023},
        {name: 'Sigourney Weaver', genre: 'science fiction', yearOfDeath: 2023},
        {name: 'Tom Cruise', genre: 'action', yearOfDeath: 2023}
        ]
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    Please note that the forEach method has mutated the original array. This is rarely desired as it cna have consequences elsewhere in the system.
    As a rule of thumb, forEach method is only for front-end handling.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        //map applies a function to each element.
        //return values are then added to a new array
        const actionStars = eightiesActors.map((actor)=> {
            actor.genre = 'family';
            return actor;
        })

    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    This creates an entirely new list where all the genres of the actors have been changed to "family". 
    Generally this is a much more desired way of doing this type of operation, as it returns a new array and leaves the original array intact (mostly).
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        //filter creates a new array with only certain elements
        const onlyAction = eightiesActors.filter((actor)=>actor.genre === 'action')
        console.log(onlyAction)
        [
        { name: 'Arnold Schwarzenegger', genre: 'action'},
        { name: 'Tom Cruise', genre: 'action'}
        ]
    </code>
</pre>
<pre>
    <code>
        //find returns the first element of the array that lives up to specifications
        console.log(eightiesActors.find(actor => actor.name === 'Tom Hanks'))
        { name: 'Tom Hanks', genre: 'comedy' }

        console.log(eightiesActors.find(actor => actor.genre === 'action'))
        { name: 'Arnold Schwarzenegger', genre: 'action'}
    </code>
</pre>
<p>The find method will only return Arnold in the last example, as it will return the first element that lives up to its criteria.</p>
<h2>Side effects</h2>
<p>Side effects are unwanted effects resulting from not handling various methods properly, most likely it is due to poor encapsulation and lax adherence to scopes</p>
