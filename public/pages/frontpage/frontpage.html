    <h2>The number one resource for node.js documentation, made by me.</h2>

    <p>This site is a repository for all the knowledge concerning Node.Js learned at KEA during my studies.
        Node.Js is a runtime environment that utilizes javascript for both its front-end and back-end needs.
        This is believed to cut down on costs for training personnel, 
        as they do not need to learn multiple languages in order to work in and maintain the application.
