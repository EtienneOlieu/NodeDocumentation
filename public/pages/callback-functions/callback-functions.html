<h1>Callback Functions</h1>

<h2>A function sent to another fucntion as an argument</h2>

<p>
    In order to start talk about calbback functions, we need to touch on a couple of other concepts.
    First off, the anonymous function.
</p>
<h2>Anonymous functions</h2>
<p>
    Sometimes we need some functionality in the code but it is not necessary to use that function again, therefore it can be useful to create an anonymous function.
    So instead of creating a function like so:
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        function random(min,max){
            return Math.floor((Math.random()*(max - min +1) -min))
        }
    </code>
</pre>
<p>We can instead write the code like this:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        const randomAnonymousFunction = function random(min,max){
            return Math.floor((Math.random()*(max - min +1) -min))
        }
    </code>
</pre>
This can be taken a step further in order to save even more on key strokes by writing the same example as an arrow or lambda function instead:
<pre>
    <code>
        const randomCompactArrowFunction = (min,max) =>  
        Math.floor((Math.random()*(max - min +1) -min))
        console.log(randomCompactArrowFunction(0,20));   
    </code>
</pre>
<p>The example above returns a random number between 0 and twenty.</p>

<h2>Now for the callback</h2>
<p>A callback function, as stated earlier, takes a function as an argument and then works on that function.
    In this example we are creating a function that can handle generic actions as text, returns the actions and a the name. Of course, this is a simple example and not really pertinent for anything else than an example. 
    Although it does illustrate the capability of callback functions to allow for modular behaviour in the code</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        function genericACtionPerformer(genericAction, genericName) {


            return genericAction(genericName)
         }
         
         const subtract = (name) => `${name} is subtracting.`
         const walk = (name) => `${name} is walking.`
         const read = (name) => `${name} is reading War and Peace.`
         
         console.log(genericACtionPerformer(subtract, "Tobias"))
            returns: 'Tobias is subtracting.'
         console.log(genericACtionPerformer(walk, "Nicolas"))
            returns: 'Nicolas is walking.'
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    But how do I use it and what for?
    In the app.js file we have several endpoints based on requests from the client, this is one of the places where a callback function is used.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        app.get("/", (req, res) => {
            res.send(frontpagePage);
        }); 
    </code>
</pre>
