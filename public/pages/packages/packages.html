<h1>Packages</h1>

<h2>A package is a package.json file which contains metadata and dependencies.</h2>

<p>
    When we work with a node.js project we are going to be dependent on certain functionalities collected in packages. 
    The most important one is express which is thge backbone of node.
</p>
<p>
    In order to install express I will need to open my terminal and type:
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        npm install express
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    This initiaties the node package manager, an inbuilt package manager found in javascript, and tells it to install express.
    Once express is installed it needs to be initialized and instantiated. 
    This is done in two ways, the second of which requires that the entire project is set to be a module, both should be done at the top of the app.js file.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        const express = require("express");
        //
        import express from 'express';
        //either way we need to instantiate express
        const app = express();
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    The more direct way to do this is to create the package.json file yourself and then put this into it. 
    Make sure to remember the quotation marks as it will not be correct json otherwise.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        {"dependencies":{
            "express":"4.18.2"
        },
        }
    </code>
</pre>
<p>Afterwards a simple command of "npm init" in the terminal will help you configure the rest.</p>
